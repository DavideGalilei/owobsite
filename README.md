> You worst nightmare is now real! Owoify (and break) all your favorite websites, with this browser extension

### Disclaimer:
This extension is a mess and will likely break all your websites and make them unreadable, it makes them cuter though.

# Installation
Chrome: go to extensions settings, enable developer mode, click on "Load Unpacked" and select this folder
Firefox: do the same, but by visiting `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`

### If you want to build it yourself:
```shell
$ nimble install https://github.com/DavideGalilei/owoifynim
$ nim c index.js
```
